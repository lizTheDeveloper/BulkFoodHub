  - AC 2: Customer can search and filter products by name, category, and ingredients
  - AC 3: Customer can complete checkout process with payment processing
- **As a wholesale buyer**, I want to access bulk pricing tiers so that I can get better deals for large quantities
  - AC 1: Wholesale buyer can see tiered pricing based on order volume
  - AC 2: Wholesale buyer can place orders meeting minimum quantity requirements
- **As a supplier**, I want to list products and manage inventory so that I can sell excess stock efficiently
  - AC 1: Supplier can create product listings with photos and descriptions
